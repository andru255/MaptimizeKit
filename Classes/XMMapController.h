 Method: initWithTileService:
 Initializes and returns a newly allocated map controller object with the specified tile service.
 
 Parameters:
	tileService - The tile service for created map controller.
 
 Returns:
	An initialized map controller object or nil if the object couldn't be created.

 Updates map using current region if needed.

 Method: refresh
 
 Clear all caches and updates map.

 Property: mapView
 
 Map view for manage.

 Unique identifier of the map in Maptimize API.

 Property: distance
 
 Grouping distance represented in pixels.
 
 Lets you customize the distance used by the clustering algorithm.
 For example, a value of 30 means that two points that would be closer than 30px on screen will end up in a cluster (25 is the default value).

 Property: aggregates
 
 Defines which aggregates functions will be executed against the points within each cluster and retrieved when performing a request.
 
 These are basically the aggregates that need to be displayed directly on the cluster, not in a popup window, for which they can be computed later.
 Please note that retrieving a lot of aggregates can lead to large responses that may degrade user experience depending on the client's bandwidth.
 Be especially careful when using concat on large strings or with lots of points.
